One hot is converting a sequence into a vector or matrix, each element of the sequence corresponds to a 01 vector, the vector length is the length of the sequence, only the corresponding position of this element is 1, and the other positions are 0
如：akfhsl
a 1 0 0 0 0 0
k 0 1 0 0 0 0
f 0 0 1 0 0 0
h 0 0 0 1 0 0
s 0 0 0 0 1 0
l 0 0 0 0 0 1
Therefore, there are several main limitations:
Dimension: The dimension of one hot depends on the length of the sequence, and when the sequence is very long, it causes the dimension to become very large.

Matrix sparsity: In this representation, only one position in a vector is non-zero, and the data is too sparse

Dimensions are not uniform: In VDJ data, the longest CDR is 38 and the minimum is 4. Although there is no risk of dimensional explosion, the gap in dimensions is large. Especially when the downstream application is the same as the input data, there are sequences of different lengths, which may affect the ability of the model to process the data and the final effect

Semantic loss: One hot encoding treats every element in the sequence equally, but there will be different degrees of correlation between the elements in the actual sequence. TCR is composed of various gene fragments encoded, but the sequences encoded by the same or the same kind of fragments must be similar, so there is a connection between the elements in this sequence, and One Hot cannot reflect this semantic relationship

解决方法：
使用embedding对序列进行编码，可以统一维度，并且能够包含语义关系，embedding向量的余弦相似度能够表达两个元素间的相似性。
